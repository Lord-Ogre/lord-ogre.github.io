      <h2>General swamp information</h2>

      <h3>What determines population growth?</h3>
      <p>Population growth is based on happiness and your unemployed ogre base. At 100 happiness you will gain 0-15% of your unemployed population in new ogres. at 50 happiness you will gain 0-7.5% of your unemployed population in new ogres. If your happiness is negative the same will happen but in reverse.</p>
      <br>

        
      <h3 id="Happiness">Happiness</h3>
      <p>Happiness is determined by averaging the happiness of each ogre in your swamp. You can check the current values of these with <a href="./commands.html#Ogretype">/ogretype</a>. Other things which change your happiness include:
      <br>
      <br>-Winning a battle as 
      <br>-Losing a battle (determined by how much you lose -10 @ 2hours of supplies)(defending only)
      <br>-taxrate (-taxrate/8)
      <br>-project rate (project rate * 8 / total population)
      <br>-Farmer - Miner fighting ( -15/30min at 1:1 ratio and no unemployment and swamp size > 10,000)
      <br>  
      <br>However, it's important to note that when you don't have enough onions, ore or money, you can only lose happiness.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>How does not having food, ore or money affect the swamp?</h3>
      <p>When you have no food, ore or money you cannot gain happiness.</p>
      <p>Money: 0-15% of unpaid ogres will quit and become unemployed ogres. You will lose 100 * debt / population in happiness </p>
      <p>Onions: 0-15% of unfed ogres will starve and die. You will lose 200 * onion deficit / population in happiness </p>
      <p>Ore: 0-15% of untooled ogres will quit and become unemployed ogres. You will lose 100 * ore deficit / population in happiness </p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <h3>Project rate</h3>
