        <h2>General swamp information</h2>

        <h3>What determines population growth?</h3>
        <p>Population growth is based on happiness and your unemployed ogre base. At 100 happiness you will gain 0-15% of your unemployed population in new ogres. at 50 happiness you will gain 0-7.5% of your unemployed population in new ogres. If your happiness is negative the same will happen but in reverse.</p>
        <br>

        
        <h3>What determines happiness?</h3>
        <p>Happiness is determined by averaging the happiness of each ogre in your swamp. You can check the current values of these with <a href="./commands.html#Ogretype">/ogretype</a>. Other things which change your happiness include:
        <br>
        <br>-Winning a battle (determined by how much you gain +10 @ 2hours of supplies)(attacking only)
        <br>-Losing a battle (determined by how much you lose -10 @ 2hours of supplies)(defending only)
        <br>-taxrate (-taxrate/8)
        <br>-project rate (project rate * 8 / total population)
        <br>-Farmer - Miner fighting ( -15/30min at 1:1 ratio and no unemployment and swamp size > 10,000)
        <br>  
        <br>However, it's important to note that when you don't have enough onions, ore or money, you can only lose happiness.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How does not having food, ore or money affect the swamp?</h3>
        <p>When you have no food, ore or money you cannot gain happiness.</p>
        <p>Money: 0-15% of unpaid ogres will quit and become unemployed ogres. You will lose 100 * debt / population in happiness </p>
        <p>Onions: 0-15% of unfed ogres will starve and die. You will lose 200 * onion deficit / population in happiness </p>
        <p>Ore: 0-15% of untooled ogres will quit and become unemployed ogres. You will lose 100 * ore deficit / population in happiness </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Battle Info</h2>

        <h3>Ogre Stats</h3>
        <p>When fighting in a battle different ogres have different stats.</p>
        <p>Attacking ogre: Health: 5, Defence: 0, Strength: 1</p>
        <p>Defending ogre: Health: 5.5, Defence: 0, Strength: 1</p>
        <p>Farm ogre: Health: 2, Defence: 0, Strength: 0.25</p>
        <p>Mine ogre: Health: 3, Defence:0, Strength: 0.5</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What is travel time determined by?</h3>
        <p>The travel time for a battle is a random amount of time between 30 seconds and half an hour</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How are the length of battles determined?</h3>
        <p>Battles are designed to last approximately 5 minutes. When armies are evenly matched. However, If you attack with a bigger army the battle will go by faster. It is important to keep in mind that reinforcing your army with <a href="./commands#Battle Reinforce">/battle reinforce</a> does not speed up the battle.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Morale</h3>
        <p>Morale is used to determine when your army will surrender in an attack or a defence. Morale is equal to your swamp's happiness at the start of the battle. Over the course of the battle you will lose 100 morale when you have lost 100% of your army. and will have a 25% chance of surrender per ogre loss at -100 morale.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Surrender</h3>
        <p>When you run out of morale and surrender you have the same losses as losing normally. However, you get to keep any remaining warriors.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How do battle rewards get determined?</h3>
        <p>After winning a battle when you are the attacking swamp you will steal 25% of their resources and money, market listings also are counted. However, any resources not yet collected with <a href="./commands.html#Harvest">/harvest</a>. The defending swamp will also lose 10% of farmers, miners and unemployed ogres.</p>


        <br><br>
        <h2>Policies</h2>
        <h3>Tax rate</h3>
        <p>Tax rate takes a percentage of the $0.40 that every ogre in your swamp earns in half an hour. With a happiness penalty of tax rate/8</p>
        <p>- Used for funding ogre activities</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Project rate</h3>
        <p>Spend an amount of money every half hour to boost happiness. At a rate of money spent * 8 / total population.</p>
        <p>- Useful when needing to get back to 100 happiness after a battle or poor swamp management</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Ogre limiter</h3>
        <p>Limits the amount of new ogres which are produced.</p>
        <p>- Useful when offline for extended periods of time to allow accurate hunger use predictions.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Civilian fighting</h3>
        <p>Chance of a farmer or a miner to start fighting in place of a warrior when your army has been defeated. But keep in mind your morale will decrease 10% faster when doing this and you can still surrender.</p>
