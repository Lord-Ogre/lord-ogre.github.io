      <h2>General swamp information</h2>

      <h3>What determines population growth?</h3>
      <p>Population growth is based on happiness and your unemployed ogre base. At 100 happiness you will gain 0-15% of your unemployed population in new ogres. at 50 happiness you will gain 0-7.5% of your unemployed population in new ogres. If your happiness is negative the same will happen but in reverse.</p>
      <br>

        
      <h3>What determines happiness?</h3>
      <p>Happiness is determined by averaging the happiness of each ogre in your swamp. You can check the current values of these with <a href="./commands.html#Ogretype">/ogretype</a>. Other things which change your happiness include:
      <br>
      <br>-Winning a battle (determined by how much you gain +10 @ 2hours of supplies)(attacking only)
      <br>-Losing a battle (determined by how much you lose -10 @ 2hours of supplies)(defending only)
      <br>-taxrate (-taxrate/8)
      <br>-project rate (project rate * 8 / total population)
      <br>-Farmer - Miner fighting ( -15/30min at 1:1 ratio and no unemployment and swamp size > 10,000)
      <br>  
      <br>However, it's important to note that when you don't have enough onions, ore or money, you can only lose happiness.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>How does not having food, ore or money affect the swamp?</h3>
      <p>When you have no food, ore or money you cannot gain happiness.</p>
      <p>Money: 0-15% of unpaid ogres will quit and become unemployed ogres. You will lose 100 * debt / population in happiness </p>
      <p>Onions: 0-15% of unfed ogres will starve and die. You will lose 200 * onion deficit / population in happiness </p>
      <p>Ore: 0-15% of untooled ogres will quit and become unemployed ogres. You will lose 100 * ore deficit / population in happiness </p>
      <br>

      <h2>Battle Info</h2>

      <h3>Ogre Stats</h3>
      <p>When fighting in a battle different ogres have different stats.</p>
      <p>Attacking ogre: Health: 5, Defence: 0, Strength: 1</p>
      <p>Defending ogre: Health: 5.5, Defence: 0, Strength: 1</p>
      <p>Farm ogre: Health: 2, Defence: 0, Strength: 0.25</p>
      <p>Mine ogre: Health: 3, Defence:0, Strength: 0.5</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What is travel time determined by?</h3>
      <p>The travel time for a battle is a random amount of time between 30 seconds and half an hour</p>
      <br>
      <h3>How are the length of battles determined?</h3>
      <p>Battles are designed to last approximately 5 minutes. When armies are evenly matched. However, If you attack with a bigger army the battle will go by faster. It is important to keep in mind that reinforcing your army with <a href="./commands#Battle Reinforce">/battle reinforce</a> does not speed up the battle.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Morale</h3>
      <p>Morale is used to determine when your army will surrender in an attack or a defence. Morale is equal to your swamp's happiness at the start of the battle. Over the course of the battle you will lose 100 morale when you have lost 100% of your army. and will have a 25% chance of surrender per ogre loss at -100 morale.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Surrender</h3>
      <p>When you run out of morale and surrender you have the same losses as losing normally. However, you get to keep any remaining warriors.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>How do battle rewards get determined?</h3>
      <p>After winning a battle when you are the attacking swamp you will steal 25% of their resources and money, market listings also are counted. However, any resources not yet collected with <a href="./commands.html#Harvest">/harvest</a>. The defending swamp will also lose 10% of farmers, miners and unemployed ogres.</p>
      <h4>Happiness gain from battles?</h4>
      <p>If you steal enough money, onions and ore to last your swamp for two hours then you will recieve the maximum 10 happiness from the battle. However it is possible to lose happiness when winning a battle if too many warriors die, using the function warriors killed in battle * 200 / total swamp population.</p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>Policies</h2>
      <h3>Tax rate</h3>
      <p>Tax rate takes a percentage of the $0.40 that every ogre in your swamp earns in half an hour. With a happiness penalty of tax rate/8</p>
      <p>- Used for funding ogre activities</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Project rate</h3>
      <p>Spend an amount of money every half hour to boost happiness. At a rate of money spent * 8 / total population.</p>
      <p>- Useful when needing to get back to 100 happiness after a battle or poor swamp management</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Ogre limiter</h3>
      <p>Limits the amount of new ogres which are produced.</p>
      <p>- Useful when offline for extended periods of time to allow accurate hunger use predictions.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Civilian fighting</h3>
      <p>Chance of a farmer or a miner to start fighting in place of a warrior when your army has been defeated. But keep in mind your morale will decrease 10% faster when doing this and you can still surrender.</p>
